I want to create a tech talk using the Slidev framework

Here is details about my talk: 

###
Name: 
You don't have an excuse not to code now! Or how to harness vibe coding efficiently

Abstract:
This will be a very nice session about vibe coding capabilities, how we use it, and what's easiest. If you are not a technical person or have not coded in a long time - it's definitely worth coming to try.

Agenda: 
- Intro: Conceptually what vibe coding is and how it changes engineering
- Overview: agents, products, code editors

Products: https://lovable.dev/, https://bolt.new/, https://v0.dev/, Gemini canvas, 
Agents: https://cursor.com/agents, https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/, https://jules.google/, https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code, https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
Editors: https://cursor.com/, https://windsurf.com/editor

- How wide is the gap between vibe-coded POC vs production system?
- How do we use vibe coding inside AXL? Our current process and how to get in! (Spoiler: just use Slack)
- Practice: How to get started if you haven't written code in 20 years! (Spoiler: it's easy)
###


Please create an initial version of this presentation, something I can iterate & build on top of.
