# Initial idea

I want to create a tech talk using the Slidev framework

Here is details about my talk: 


Name: You don't have an excuse not to code now! Or how to harness vibe coding efficiently

Abstract:
This will be a very nice session about vibe coding capabilities, how we use it, and what's easiest. If you are not a technical person or have not coded in a long time - it's definitely worth coming to try.

Agenda: 
- Intro: Conceptually what vibe coding is and how it changes engineering
- Overview: agents, products, code editors

Products: https://lovable.dev/, https://bolt.new/, https://v0.dev/, Gemini canvas, 
Agents: https://cursor.com/agents, https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/, https://jules.google/, https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code, https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
Editors: https://cursor.com/, https://windsurf.com/editor

- How wide is the gap between vibe-coded POC vs production system?
- How do we use vibe coding inside AXL? Our current process and how to get in! (Spoiler: just use Slack)
- Practice: How to get started if you haven't written code in 20 years! (Spoiler: it's easy)

6. But usually with good products: diagram [product, agents, editors]

Products: https://lovable.dev/, https://bolt.new/, https://v0.dev/, https://gemini.google/overview/canvas/ 
Agents: https://cursor.com/agents, https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/, https://jules.google/, https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code, https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
Editors: https://cursor.com/, https://windsurf.com/editor, https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat, https://github.com/zed-industries/zed

7. Products: diagram [prodcut, agetns, editros] - interconnect 

8. Products: TRY! (INTERACTIVE)


GAP:

1. meme with Jan Clode Wan Dam
2. good at code != sovle problmes with tech
3. best code you never wrote! 
4. costs of software == ownership


5. cases: bombarderd with CORs
6. peoepl are actual learning progremming 
7. pre LLM you can build web in 2 months

8. stuctural visualization: martin fouler
9. stuctural visualization: accelerate 
10. Karpathyu - keep agent on the leash
11. Takeaways: POC great, senour - amazing, junior - very bad! 

AXL: 


1. out setup: cursor show
2. cursor stats
3. ask team mate! 
4. pre-requisites: PR - atomic piache of work, CI/CD - something who laod app. Deployment -> Life 
5. Opetions 1: Slack - Tovi example 
6. Opetions 2: Dashboard - Tovi example 
6. Opetions 3: Mobile - Tovi example
